⚙️ Technical Decisions

Spring Boot → fast microservice development.
Spring Data JPA → repository abstraction (fits DDD Repositories).
Flyway → DB versioning → ensures domain model consistency across environments.
Springdoc + Swagger → explicit API contracts → supports ubiquitous language.
RabbitMQ → async integration across bounded contexts.
Config Server → centralized configuration = single source of truth.
